    "text": "I started writing my blog, Monkey’s Uncle, back in 2008. My wife had major surgery and I was a bit distracted from the task of academic writing. I thought that having a blog might allow me to keep writing in a mode that would require less concentration. Somewhat to my surprise, it worked pretty well.\nAs I wrote more, a funny thing happened. People actually read my posts and sometimes this led to collaborations. One of my most productive collaborations came about because Marcel Salathé chanced upon my blog. We went on to write what would be several of the most-cited papers (for example: here here and here) either of us would write (so far, at least).\nIn the last few years, I’ve essentially stopped blogging. Stanford and WordPress never completely got along and it was always a bit of a hassle to maintain. The folder that held the images for blog posts somehow disappeared and now the posts that were supposed to have embedded images just have blind links in them. For a while, Twitter effectively took the place of the blog. Putting together threads describing my work was fun, but with Twitter’s effective demise as a reasonable tool for scientific communication, I’ve found myself wanting to get back into actual blogging. The seed for re-starting my blog was actually planted by John Quiggin’s lament (in a comment on my extra-long Twitter thread) that people don’t blog anymore. I have also been inspired by my interactions with Henry Farrell, who both blogs on his personal site and is a regular contributor to Crooked Timber.\nQuarto has opened up new opportunities for blogging. I already use it for my course notes and my lab manual, so it seemed natural to give it a try for blogging as well. Quarto has the tremendous benefit of supporting technical writing, embedding code, rendering equations, etc. This sounds promising: my previous blog posts had less of this material than I wanted because of technical limitations of the site.\nThere will be a learning curve here, no doubt. The aesthetics are a bit spare so far. Hopefully, I can figure out how to make a nice header, maybe even with my favorite monkey picture.\n\n\n\nRed colobus mother with infant, sitting on the ground, observing the drama taking place in the trees above her. Picture taken in Kibale National Park, Uganda in 2012.\n\n\nMy goal is to keep my posts a bit shorter than during peak Monkey’s Uncle. I mean, seriously, who really wants to read a 7000-word, slightly emo essay on the sad state of contemporary anthropology?\nI don’t use Twitter anymore, but you can find me on Blueksy. I also have a Mastodon account. So far, at least, these are a far cry from peak Academic Twitter, but they have promise. Fewer right-wing trolls and Russian bots, so they’ve got that going for them."

    "text": "I will be teaching my class, Earth System Science 185: Adaptation, again this winter quarter. One of the stated learning outcomes for this class is to be able to “interpret complex scientific figures.” I show the class lots of figures and ask them in all of the problem sets and both exams to interpret scientific figures. These figures are usually theoretical, though they sometimes involve data. This is largely a theory class though, so lots of theoretical ecology, evolution, and complex systems.\nTo supplement lecture this year, I have assembled some notes on interpreting and rendering scientific figures. These notes are highly incomplete, but they represent a pretty good start. I have learned some hard-won tricks for making attractive and clear scientific figures in R and it seemed like a good idea to assemble them in one place. You can find these notes (which I hope to update as the quarter proceeds) here.\nAn example of the sort of scientific figure we work with is the Noy-Meir (1975) model for stability of grazing systems. The following figure represents the core idea of Noy-Meir’s model.\n\n# Logistic Recruitment\nlogistic.recruit &lt;- expression(r*N*(1 - (N/K)^theta))\nno &lt;- 1\nr &lt;- 0.45\nK &lt;- 100\ntheta &lt;- 1\nN &lt;- seq(0,K,length=500)\n\n# Holling Type II Functional Response\nh2 &lt;- expression(a*N/(b + a*x))\nx &lt;- N+1\na &lt;- 0.7\nb &lt;- 3\nplot(N,eval(logistic.recruit), type=\"l\", yaxs=\"i\", lwd=3, axes=FALSE, xlab=\"Relative Producer Density\", ylab=\"Relative Productivity\", ylim=c(0,15))\nbox()\nlines(x, 6*eval(h2), lwd=2)\nlines(x, 12*eval(h2), lwd=2)\n\npoints(c(8.702413, 36.521362, 57.497146, 85.464859), c(3.485678, 10.441517, 11.003335,  5.652690), col=c(\"red\",\"red\",\"green\",\"green\"), cex=2, pch=16)\narrows(36.521362-7.5, 10.441517+2, 36.521362-1, 10.441517+2, code=1, lwd=3, length=0.1, col=grey(0.75))\narrows(36.521362+1, 10.441517+2, 36.521362+7.5, 10.441517+2, code=2, lwd=3, length=0.1, col=grey(0.75))\n#\narrows(57.497146-7.5, 10.441517+2, 57.497146-1, 10.441517+2, code=2, lwd=3, length=0.1, col=grey(0.75))\narrows(57.497146+1, 10.441517+2, 57.497146+7.5, 10.441517+2, code=1, lwd=3, length=0.1, col=grey(0.75))\ntext(c(59.13355, 86.65497), c(11.458140,  6.107494), c(\"F2\", \"F1\"))\n\n\n\n\nThe primary producers have a logistic recruitment curve, while grazers follow a Holling Type II functional response. Points where these curves intersect represent equilibria of the system. The green points are stable, whereas the red points are unstable (stability indicated by the grey arrows above the curves). The two consumption curves represent potential slow-forcing of the system from population growth of the consumer. Population growth can easily lead to the loss of the stable equilibria of the system, leading to catastrophic collapse.\nTo be honest, I’m not sure if these notes will ever move beyond class notes. So far, I have four chapters:\n\ninterpreting scientific figures\ndrawing a rogues’ gallery of classic figures from theoretical ecology, behavioral ecology, economics, and complexity theory\n“actual graphs” (i.e., networks)\nnumerically integrating (and plotting!) ODEs\n\nThese are my various non-standard uses for R graphics (i.e., as opposed to actually plotting data!)."
