    "text": "I started writing my blog, Monkey’s Uncle, back in 2008. My wife had major surgery and I was a bit distracted from the task of academic writing. I thought that having a blog might allow me to keep writing in a mode that would require less concentration. Somewhat to my surprise, it worked pretty well.\nAs I wrote more, a funny thing happened. People actually read my posts and sometimes this led to collaborations. One of my most productive collaborations came about because Marcel Salathé chanced upon my blog. We went on to write what would be several of the most-cited papers (for example: here here and here) either of us would write (so far, at least).\nIn the last few years, I’ve essentially stopped blogging. Stanford and WordPress never completely got along and it was always a bit of a hassle to maintain. The folder that held the images for blog posts somehow disappeared and now the posts that were supposed to have embedded images just have blind links in them. For a while, Twitter effectively took the place of the blog. Putting together threads describing my work was fun, but with Twitter’s effective demise as a reasonable tool for scientific communication, I’ve found myself wanting to get back into actual blogging. The seed for re-starting my blog was actually planted by John Quiggin’s lament (in a comment on my extra-long Twitter thread) that people don’t blog anymore. I have also been inspired by my interactions with Henry Farrell, who both blogs on his personal site and is a regular contributor to Crooked Timber.\nQuarto has opened up new opportunities for blogging. I already use it for my course notes and my lab manual, so it seemed natural to give it a try for blogging as well. Quarto has the tremendous benefit of supporting technical writing, embedding code, rendering equations, etc. This sounds promising: my previous blog posts had less of this material than I wanted because of technical limitations of the site.\nThere will be a learning curve here, no doubt. The aesthetics are a bit spare so far. Hopefully, I can figure out how to make a nice header, maybe even with my favorite monkey picture.\n\n\n\nRed colobus mother with infant, sitting on the ground, observing the drama taking place in the trees above her. Picture taken in Kibale National Park, Uganda in 2012.\n\n\nMy goal is to keep my posts a bit shorter than during peak Monkey’s Uncle. I mean, seriously, who really wants to read a 7000-word, slightly emo essay on the sad state of contemporary anthropology?\nI don’t use Twitter anymore, but you can find me on Blueksy. I also have a Mastodon account. So far, at least, these are a far cry from peak Academic Twitter, but they have promise. Fewer right-wing trolls and Russian bots, so they’ve got that going for them."

    "section": "",
    "text": "I will be teaching my class, Earth System Science 185: Adaptation, again this winter quarter. One of the stated learning outcomes for this class is to be able to “interpret complex scientific figures.” I show the class lots of figures and ask them in all of the problem sets and both exams to interpret scientific figures. These figures are usually theoretical, though they sometimes involve data. This is largely a theory class though, so lots of theoretical ecology, evolution, and complex systems.\nTo supplement lecture this year, I have assembled some notes on interpreting and rendering scientific figures. These notes are highly incomplete, but they represent a pretty good start. I have learned some hard-won tricks for making attractive and clear scientific figures in R and it seemed like a good idea to assemble them in one place. You can find these notes (which I hope to update as the quarter proceeds) here.\nAn example of the sort of scientific figure we work with is the Noy-Meir (1975) model for stability of grazing systems. The following figure represents the core idea of Noy-Meir’s model.\n\n# Logistic Recruitment\nlogistic.recruit &lt;- expression(r*N*(1 - (N/K)^theta))\nno &lt;- 1\nr &lt;- 0.45\nK &lt;- 100\ntheta &lt;- 1\nN &lt;- seq(0,K,length=500)\n\n# Holling Type II Functional Response\nh2 &lt;- expression(a*N/(b + a*x))\nx &lt;- N+1\na &lt;- 0.7\nb &lt;- 3\nplot(N,eval(logistic.recruit), type=\"l\", yaxs=\"i\", lwd=3, axes=FALSE, xlab=\"Relative Producer Density\", ylab=\"Relative Productivity\", ylim=c(0,15))\nbox()\nlines(x, 6*eval(h2), lwd=2)\nlines(x, 12*eval(h2), lwd=2)\n\npoints(c(8.702413, 36.521362, 57.497146, 85.464859), c(3.485678, 10.441517, 11.003335,  5.652690), col=c(\"red\",\"red\",\"green\",\"green\"), cex=2, pch=16)\narrows(36.521362-7.5, 10.441517+2, 36.521362-1, 10.441517+2, code=1, lwd=3, length=0.1, col=grey(0.75))\narrows(36.521362+1, 10.441517+2, 36.521362+7.5, 10.441517+2, code=2, lwd=3, length=0.1, col=grey(0.75))\n#\narrows(57.497146-7.5, 10.441517+2, 57.497146-1, 10.441517+2, code=2, lwd=3, length=0.1, col=grey(0.75))\narrows(57.497146+1, 10.441517+2, 57.497146+7.5, 10.441517+2, code=1, lwd=3, length=0.1, col=grey(0.75))\ntext(c(59.13355, 86.65497), c(11.458140,  6.107494), c(\"F2\", \"F1\"))\n\n\n\n\nThe primary producers have a logistic recruitment curve, while grazers follow a Holling Type II functional response. Points where these curves intersect represent equilibria of the system. The green points are stable, whereas the red points are unstable (stability indicated by the grey arrows above the curves). The two consumption curves represent potential slow-forcing of the system from population growth of the consumer. Population growth can easily lead to the loss of the stable equilibria of the system, leading to catastrophic collapse.\nTo be honest, I’m not sure if these notes will ever move beyond class notes. So far, I have four chapters:\n\ninterpreting scientific figures\ndrawing a rogues’ gallery of classic figures from theoretical ecology, behavioral ecology, economics, and complexity theory\n“actual graphs” (i.e., networks)\nnumerically integrating (and plotting!) ODEs\n\nThese are my various non-standard uses for R graphics (i.e., as opposed to actually plotting data!)."

    "title": "Imagining Adaptive Societies",
    "section": "",
    "text": "This winter, I once again have the great fortune of co-teaching with Margaret Levi and Paula Moya our class entitled Imagining Adaptive Societies. In this class, we explore how speculative fiction can be used as a tool for imagining adaptable, sustainable, and just societies that can respond to the major challenges of our age. When it comes to the topic of environmental change, it’s so easy to get bogged down in dystopia. We make a concerted effort to think about better futures. Frankly, this can be a bit of a challenge, but that’s part of what makes the project interesting.\nMy fascination (some might suggest obsession) with climate fiction, or CliFi, first started when my friend Michael McElliott (a.k.a., Mikl Em), who was the producer of the long-running lecture series at the Long Now Foundation’s hilariously-hipster bar in San Francisco, The Interval, invited me to the Interval’s green room in May of 2017 to hang out with the author and CliFi pioneer Kim Stanley Robinson, who was doing a reading from his recent CliFi novel, New York 2140.\n\n\n\nKim Stanley Robinson, reading from his novel New York 2140, at The Interval, May 9 2017.\n\n\nWith KSR, his entourage, and Mikl, we talked extensively about the role of the world-building one has to do for speculative fiction in helping us think about adaptation, sustainability, and human-environment interactions more generally. Mikl, who was a massive science-fiction nerd, turned to me at one point and said, “you should give a talk on CliFi at the Interval!” I demurred. While it is true that I have read a lot of science fiction and thought a bit about its utility in stimulating imagination, I know nothing about literature or how one even goes about teaching a class rooted in the humanities.\nBut the seed was definitely planted.\nWhen my wife was a fellow at the Center for Advanced Study in the Behavioral Sciences in 2017-2018, I spent a lot of time loitering up on the hill and talking with then-director Margaret Levi and various other smarties like Shaz Attari and Judy Wajcman about CliFi. On a Stanford Alumni Association trip in the summer of 2018, I was inspired by the spectacular locale of the Mashpi Lodge in Ecuador to roll out a first draft of a talk on CliFi. Eventually, I did give a version of the talk at the Interval. I focused on how long-form narrative might fit into the science of behavior change. This led to a nice write-up by the Stanford News Service, where I got to chat about the utility of literature with Pulitzer-Prize-winning author Adam Johnson. That was cool.\nShortly before the COVID-19 pandemic, Margaret Levi and I received a grant from The Changing Human Experience Initiative at Stanford for a project focused on the social imagination in speculative fiction, especially CliFi. There is lots of humanistic scholarship on speculative fiction and there are plenty of physical scientists who weigh in on the topic (and are frequently authors!). But, as noted by Robert Heinlein in his famous 1947 essay, speculative fiction is not fiction about the science and technology, per se, but rather human reactions to new situations caused by science and technology. It seemed to us like there was a real deficit on the social-science scholarship related to world-building and speculative fiction.\nWe had grand plans. Alas, the pandemic really messed them up. It’s a long and not very interesting story—as with so many pandemic-disruption stories—but we decided that the best way to fulfill the spirit of the project was to teach a class. We recruited Paula, who has a long-standing interest in speculative fiction and actually knows about literature!\nSo, here we are. This is the second time we’re teaching the class and it might, alas, be the last. Margaret is retired and winter quarter is her last teaching quarter at Stanford. It should be fun. I’ve learned so much from Margaret and Paula, not to mention our students and TAs. This year, we will read three novels\n\nParable of the Sower by Octavia Butler\nNew York 2140 by Kim Stanley Robinson\nThe Water Knife by Paolo Bacigalupi\n\nIn addition, we will read a number of shorter works, including selections from KSR’s Ministry of the Future, N.K. Jemisin’s novelette, Emergency Skin, and short stories by Malka Older (“Narrative Disorder”) and Charlie Jane Anders (“Because Change was the Ocean and We Lived by her Mercy”). We might even have some visitors, but that’s a secret (for now).\nWe try to triple-team every lecture. I generally talk about the climate science and human ecology; Margaret talks about the governance, history, and social elements of the works; Paula talks about the novels as works of literature, analyzing the plots and characters and generally improving everyone’s analytical game.\nWe start in a week. Here’s hoping my recently-operated-upon ankle has healed enough by then that I can actually walk to class!"

    "text": "I managed to read 28 novels in 2023. Most of these were climate fiction since that remains a teaching (and possibly research) interest.\nIn no particular order, my favorite novels from this past year include:\n\nLauren Wilkinson, American Spy\nThomas D. Lee, Perilous Times\nMalka Older, The Mimicking of Known Successes\nRay Nayler, The Mountain in the Sea\n\nAnother book that I really enjoyed, but wasn’t quite self-contained enough for me to list here is A Psalm for the Wild-Built, Becky Chambers’s first novel in her new cozy CliFi series. I’m anxiously awaiting the next volumes in the series.\nBecky Chambers and Annalee Newitz talk about cozy science fiction more generally in their terrific talk at The Interval, entitled Resisting Dystopia. The idea of resisting dystopia is, in fact, one of the guiding principles of the class I am teaching with Margaret Levi and Paula Moya this quarter. It’s not always easy, I’m afraid.\nMalka Older’s amazing The Mimicking of Known Successes is, apparently, also considered to be of the cozy genre, though I found the setting for it pretty terrifying. A devastated Earth and a scholarly outpost on a gas giant inhospitable to life doesn’t strike me as canonically “cozy,” but I guess there is lots of tea-drinking in academic chambers.\nOne of these things is perhaps not like the others, so merits a moment’s reflection. Wilkinson’s American Spy is a masterful modern take on the spy novel. I think that there are three necessary elements to a successful spy novel. First, and most importantly, there must be moral ambiguity. If it’s not morally ambiguous, are you even spying, bro? Second, there needs to be geographic specificity. The reader needs enough detail to be transported to where the action is, whether it is in some exotic locale, the streets of New York City or London, or the back roads of northern Virginia. Finally, what would a spy novel be without tradecraft? And I don’t mean the Q-esque gadgets here. Neither George Smilely nor Marie Mitchell have—nor need—flame-throwing watches or tricked-out sport cars. Wilkinson delivers spectacularly on all fronts. It is right up there with my all-time favorite spy novels—and I’m an often-disappointed sucker for the genre. A fictionalized account of the assassination of the charismatic leftist president of Burkina Faso, Thomas Sankara, American Spy—as with all the best geopolitical fiction— may force you to learn something if you’re not careful (I did)."

    "section": "",
    "text": "I have been pretty obsessed with risk for a while now. My interest in formal risk management was piqued when I began thinking about life-history strategies for variable environments. The formal analysis of risk seemed like a pretty big absence from life history theory, particularly in the literature pertaining to the evolution of human life histories. I first articulated some of these ideas in a review I wrote for Current Biology back in 2011. A more recent articulation of this work as it relates to life histories is this paper with Mike Price, where we show that fitness maximizers employ nonlinear probability weighting to decisions (with life-history consequences) under risk. This may sound a bit obscure, but it’s important because nonlinear probability weighting is one of the hallmarks of economic irrationality as seen by the Biases and Heuristics school of behavioral economics. Nonlinear probability weighting may not be rational from the orthodox axiomatic perspective, but it will keep you from going extinct! Better alive and “irrational” than extinct and consistent with some dude’s (arbitrary) axioms.\nWithout getting too far into the weeds, the standard approach to decision-making under risk involves choosing the “prospect” (i.e., a course of action with a variable payoff) with the greatest expected utility. That is, for all the prospects you’re choosing between, sum up the products of the utility of each possible outcome and its associated probability (that’s what an expectation is) and pick the one that’s biggest. If we’re thinking about evolution, we would substitute the word “strategy” for “prospect” and, of course, “fitness” for “utility,” but the decision criterion remains the same. We now just imagine that it’s natural selection that is “choosing” in the sense that individuals who employ strategies with the highest expected fitness will come to dominate the population.\nAs Mike’s an my paper suggests, it might actually be more complicated than that."

    "text": "Uncertainty Creeps In\nMore recently, I’ve done a bit of a re-think on things and have come to the conclusion that the real action for understanding human evolution—and the future of human adaptation—is uncertainty. Colloquially, risk and uncertainty sound similar. They both involve non-deterministic payoffs. But there is a fundamental difference between them that was recognized over a hundred years ago in the publications of two of history’s great economists. Both John Maynard Keynes and Frank Wright published major works in 1921. In Risk, Uncertainty, and Profit, Knight neatly summarized the fundamental distinction between risk and uncertainty, “Uncertainty must be taken in a sense radically distinct from the familiar notion of Risk, from which it has never been properly separated…The essential fact is that ‘risk’ means in some cases a quantity susceptible of measurement, while at other times it is something distinctly not of this character; and there are far-reaching and crucial differences in the bearings of the phenomena depending on which of the two is really present and operating…. It will appear that a measurable uncertainty, or ‘risk’ proper, as we shall use the term, is so far different from an unmeasurable one that it is not in effect an uncertainty at all.”\nA full articulation of his views of uncertainty would not come from Keynes until the later publication of his better-known, General Theory in 1936, but in his 1921 Treatise on Probability, he did express great skepticism about the usefulness of expectations in rational decision-making. The language he used reflected his unorthodox views on probabilities. In part IV of his Treatise, Keynes wrote “The second difficulty, to which attention is called above, is the neglect of the ‘weights’ of arguments in the conception of ‘mathematical expectation.’ … In the present connection the question comes to this—if two probabilities are equal in degree, ought we, in choosing our course of action, to prefer that one which is based on a greater body of knowledge?” Here, he was really saying essentially the same thing as Knight. If we can’t actually measure the probabilities properly, we can’t use expectations to guide our decisions.\nI now have a lot to say about uncertainty and how organisms faced with it might nonetheless make adaptive decisions. I will save this for future posts—and maybe even some peer-reviewed publications? (hope springs eternal). However, for the rest of this post, I will lay out what I think is a pretty heuristic way of thinking about what uncertainty is."

    "text": "Uncertainty is Horizontal\nSuppose we have absolute uncertainty over the value of some outcome. That is, we have absolutely no idea what the value could be. What we get is a uniform distribution, which looks like a horizontal line drawn at a height such that the area under it sums to one. If we really have no idea whatsoever what the value can be, then this line goes from minus infinity to infinity and is infinitesimally high.\n\nx &lt;- seq(-10,10,length=1000)\nplot(x,dunif(x,-10,10), type=\"n\", axes=FALSE, frame=TRUE,\n     xlab=\"Outcome\", ylab=\"Probability of Outcome\")\narrows(-10,0.05,10,0.05,code=3, lwd=2)\n\n\n\n\nWe gather data to help us estimate the outcome. The more informative the data are that, the more precise our estimate will be. The effect that this has on our probability distribution is as though we were simultaneously pushing up at the most likely value compatible with the data and down on the extremes. Note that failure to observe extreme values is itself information and the more trials you go without observing extreme events, the more your beliefs shift to believe that extremes are rare.\n\nplot(x,dunif(x,-10,10), type=\"n\", axes=FALSE, frame=TRUE,\n     xlab=\"Outcome\", ylab=\"Probability of Outcome\")\narrows(-10,0.05,10,0.05,code=3, lwd=2)\narrows(-7,0.051,-7,0.1, col=\"red\", code=1, lwd=2)\narrows(7,0.051,7,0.1, col=\"red\", code=1, lwd=2)\narrows(0,0,0,0.049, col=\"red\", code=2, lwd=2)\n\n\n\n##\nplot(x,dnorm(x,0,3.5), type=\"l\", lwd=2, axes=FALSE, frame=TRUE,\n     yaxs=\"i\", ylim=c(0,0.12),\n     xlab=\"Outcome\", ylab=\"Probability of Outcome\")\narrows(-7,0.051,-7,0.1, col=\"red\", code=1, lwd=2)\narrows(7,0.051,7,0.1, col=\"red\", code=1, lwd=2)\narrows(0,0,0,0.049, col=\"red\", code=2, lwd=2)\n\n\n\n\nAs we keep adding informative observations, our distribution becomes taller and has shorter tails.\n\nplot(x,dnorm(x), type=\"l\", lwd=2, axes=FALSE, frame=TRUE, \n     yaxs=\"i\", ylim=c(0,0.42), xlim=c(-10,10),\n     xlab=\"Outcome\", ylab=\"Probability of Outcome\")\narrows(-7,0.051,-7,0.1, col=\"red\", code=1, lwd=2)\narrows(7,0.051,7,0.1, col=\"red\", code=1, lwd=2)\narrows(0,0,0,0.049, col=\"red\", code=2, lwd=2)\n\n\n\n\nIn the limit, if our data were perfectly informative, we would get a point mass on the “true” value of the outcome. This is a magical world that I frankly don’t believe in—diversity is the rule in biology—but it is useful to think of the two limiting cases that bracket our ability to estimate things: complete uncertainty is a horizontal line; complete certainty is a vertical line.\nSo as we make ourselves less uncertain, we make our probability distribution more vertical around a central point. Returning to the Keynesian perspective on uncertainty, suppose we have an estimate of our outcome, but that we are not at all certain that our probabilities are correct. They have low ‘weights’ in the Keynesian sense. This case is actually nicely formalized in a Bayesian framework when we marginalize, i.e., average our estimates over unknown (nuisance) parameters. The canonical case is estimating a normal mean with unknown variance using the conjugate model. I will save the details for another post, but the punchline is that the distribution of a normal mean with unknown variance under the standard conjugate model is a t-distribution with degrees of freedom equal to the sample size of your data.\nThis may seem unremarkable. We’ve all done t-tests. The thing is, the t-distribution has some pretty wild properties. Most notable among these is that it is heavy-tailed (or fat-tailed). There is a nice, relatively new text (including full preprint) on heavy-tailed distributions here. Heavy-tailed distributions are one way of thinking about uncertainty.\nAgain, I will leave the details for a later post, but the upshot is that heavy-tailed distributions break expectations. In a short paper in 2001, John Geweke pointed out the degeneracy of expected utility under heavy-tailed distributions. I don’t think enough people know about this result and I will write much more about it later.\nFor now, let’s just let is suffice to say that a heavy tail is kind of like adding back that horizontal element to a probability distribution. The tails aren’t really horizontal, but they’re certainly more horizontal than thin-tailed distribution: by definition, the probability of a heavy-tailed variate decays sub-linearly on a log scale (i.e., slower than exponential).\nHere’s a comparison of our normal distribution with a low-df t-distribution. While the two distributions are centered on the same point, the t-distribution is less peaked, has wider shoulders, and much heavier tails. We are less certain of our estimate.\n\nplot(x,dnorm(x), type=\"l\", lwd=2, axes=FALSE, frame=TRUE, \n     yaxs=\"i\", ylim=c(0,0.42), xlim=c(-10,10),\n     xlab=\"Outcome\", ylab=\"Probability of Outcome\")\nlines(x,dt(x,df=1), lwd=2, col=\"red\")"

    "text": "Heavy Tails Make The Impossible Only Unlikely\nThe existence of a heavy-tailed distribution means that very large (or very small) values are not impossible. We can compare the tails of a normal distribution and a low-df t-distribution.\n\nplot(x,dnorm(x), type=\"l\", lwd=2, axes=FALSE, frame=TRUE, \n     yaxs=\"i\", xaxs=\"i\", ylim=c(0,0.4), xlim=c(0,10),\n     xlab=\"Outcome\", ylab=\"Probability of Outcome\")\nlines(x,dt(x,df=1), lwd=2, col=\"red\")\nabline(h=0.01,lty=3)\naxis(1)\naxis(2)\n\n\n\n\nIt’s common to refer to extreme events by the number of standard deviations they are from the mean. As the conventional variable name for standard deviation is \\(\\sigma\\), we call something the magnitude of which is two standard deviations away from the mean a \\(2\\sigma\\) event, and so on. From the figure, we can see that while the probability of observing a \\(4\\sigma\\) event is essentially zero for the normal distribution, the probability of a \\(6\\sigma\\) event is approximately 1% (1 year out of 100). The probability of a \\(9\\sigma\\) event is 0.5% and of a \\(10\\sigma\\) event is 0.3%. Another way to think about that is that we should expect a \\(10\\sigma\\) event approximately every 300 years or about 12 human generations.\nThe nonzero probability of these very extreme events causes the variance to blow up. The variance is, in fact, infinite for this distribution (and for \\(df=1\\), the mean is undefined since a standard t-distribution with one degree of freedom is also a Cauchy (0,1) distribution).\nIt’s touch to try to minimize variance when the variance is infinite! It’s also impossible to rank prospects according to their moments (e.g., mean and variance) when the moments aren’t defined.\nOrganisms (like humans) who face real—or Knightean—uncertainty still need to make decisions. If they can’t choose on the basis of expectations, what do they do? It’s an important question and will be the subject of future posts and (hopefully) forthcoming papers."
