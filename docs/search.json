    "text": "I started writing my blog, Monkey’s Uncle, back in 2008. My wife had major surgery and I was a bit distracted from the task of academic writing. I thought that having a blog might allow me to keep writing in a mode that would require less concentration. Somewhat to my surprise, it worked pretty well.\nAs I wrote more, a funny thing happened. People actually read my posts and sometimes this led to collaborations. One of my most productive collaborations came about because Marcel Salathé chanced upon my blog. We went on to write what would be several of the most-cited papers (for example: here here and here) either of us would write (so far, at least).\nIn the last few years, I’ve essentially stopped blogging. Stanford and WordPress never completely got along and it was always a bit of a hassle to maintain. The folder that held the images for blog posts somehow disappeared and now the posts that were supposed to have embedded images just have blind links in them. For a while, Twitter effectively took the place of the blog. Putting together threads describing my work was fun, but with Twitter’s effective demise as a reasonable tool for scientific communication, I’ve found myself wanting to get back into actual blogging. The seed for re-starting my blog was actually planted by John Quiggin’s lament (in a comment on my extra-long Twitter thread) that people don’t blog anymore. I have also been inspired by my interactions with Henry Farrell, who both blogs on his personal site and is a regular contributor to Crooked Timber.\nQuarto has opened up new opportunities for blogging. I already use it for my course notes and my lab manual, so it seemed natural to give it a try for blogging as well. Quarto has the tremendous benefit of supporting technical writing, embedding code, rendering equations, etc. This sounds promising: my previous blog posts had less of this material than I wanted because of technical limitations of the site.\nThere will be a learning curve here, no doubt. The aesthetics are a bit spare so far. Hopefully, I can figure out how to make a nice header, maybe even with my favorite monkey picture.\n\n\n\nRed colobus mother with infant, sitting on the ground, observing the drama taking place in the trees above her. Picture taken in Kibale National Park, Uganda in 2012.\n\n\nMy goal is to keep my posts a bit shorter than during peak Monkey’s Uncle. I mean, seriously, who really wants to read a 7000-word, slightly emo essay on the sad state of contemporary anthropology?\nI don’t use Twitter anymore, but you can find me on Blueksy. I also have a Mastodon account. So far, at least, these are a far cry from peak Academic Twitter, but they have promise. Fewer right-wing trolls and Russian bots, so they’ve got that going for them."

    "section": "",
    "text": "I will be teaching my class, Earth System Science 185: Adaptation, again this winter quarter. One of the stated learning outcomes for this class is to be able to “interpret complex scientific figures.” I show the class lots of figures and ask them in all of the problem sets and both exams to interpret scientific figures. These figures are usually theoretical, though they sometimes involve data. This is largely a theory class though, so lots of theoretical ecology, evolution, and complex systems.\nTo supplement lecture this year, I have assembled some notes on interpreting and rendering scientific figures. These notes are highly incomplete, but they represent a pretty good start. I have learned some hard-won tricks for making attractive and clear scientific figures in R and it seemed like a good idea to assemble them in one place. You can find these notes (which I hope to update as the quarter proceeds) here.\nAn example of the sort of scientific figure we work with is the Noy-Meir (1975) model for stability of grazing systems. The following figure represents the core idea of Noy-Meir’s model.\n\n# Logistic Recruitment\nlogistic.recruit &lt;- expression(r*N*(1 - (N/K)^theta))\nno &lt;- 1\nr &lt;- 0.45\nK &lt;- 100\ntheta &lt;- 1\nN &lt;- seq(0,K,length=500)\n\n# Holling Type II Functional Response\nh2 &lt;- expression(a*N/(b + a*x))\nx &lt;- N+1\na &lt;- 0.7\nb &lt;- 3\nplot(N,eval(logistic.recruit), type=\"l\", yaxs=\"i\", lwd=3, axes=FALSE, xlab=\"Relative Producer Density\", ylab=\"Relative Productivity\", ylim=c(0,15))\nbox()\nlines(x, 6*eval(h2), lwd=2)\nlines(x, 12*eval(h2), lwd=2)\n\npoints(c(8.702413, 36.521362, 57.497146, 85.464859), c(3.485678, 10.441517, 11.003335,  5.652690), col=c(\"red\",\"red\",\"green\",\"green\"), cex=2, pch=16)\narrows(36.521362-7.5, 10.441517+2, 36.521362-1, 10.441517+2, code=1, lwd=3, length=0.1, col=grey(0.75))\narrows(36.521362+1, 10.441517+2, 36.521362+7.5, 10.441517+2, code=2, lwd=3, length=0.1, col=grey(0.75))\n#\narrows(57.497146-7.5, 10.441517+2, 57.497146-1, 10.441517+2, code=2, lwd=3, length=0.1, col=grey(0.75))\narrows(57.497146+1, 10.441517+2, 57.497146+7.5, 10.441517+2, code=1, lwd=3, length=0.1, col=grey(0.75))\ntext(c(59.13355, 86.65497), c(11.458140,  6.107494), c(\"F2\", \"F1\"))\n\n\n\n\nThe primary producers have a logistic recruitment curve, while grazers follow a Holling Type II functional response. Points where these curves intersect represent equilibria of the system. The green points are stable, whereas the red points are unstable (stability indicated by the grey arrows above the curves). The two consumption curves represent potential slow-forcing of the system from population growth of the consumer. Population growth can easily lead to the loss of the stable equilibria of the system, leading to catastrophic collapse.\nTo be honest, I’m not sure if these notes will ever move beyond class notes. So far, I have four chapters:\n\ninterpreting scientific figures\ndrawing a rogues’ gallery of classic figures from theoretical ecology, behavioral ecology, economics, and complexity theory\n“actual graphs” (i.e., networks)\nnumerically integrating (and plotting!) ODEs\n\nThese are my various non-standard uses for R graphics (i.e., as opposed to actually plotting data!)."

    "title": "Imagining Adaptive Societies",
    "section": "",
    "text": "This winter, I once again have the great fortune of co-teaching with Margaret Levi and Paula Moya our class entitled Imagining Adaptive Societies. In this class, we explore how speculative fiction can be used as a tool for imagining adaptable, sustainable, and just societies that can respond to the major challenges of our age. When it comes to the topic of environmental change, it’s so easy to get bogged down in dystopia. We make a concerted effort to think about better futures. Frankly, this can be a bit of a challenge, but that’s part of what makes the project interesting.\nMy fascination (some might suggest obsession) with climate fiction, or CliFi, first started when my friend Michael McElliott (a.k.a., Mikl Em), who was the producer of the long-running lecture series at the Long Now Foundation’s hilariously-hipster bar in San Francisco, The Interval, invited me to the Interval’s green room in May of 2017 to hang out with the author and CliFi pioneer Kim Stanley Robinson, who was doing a reading from his recent CliFi novel, New York 2140.\n\n\n\nKim Stanley Robinson, reading from his novel New York 2140, at The Interval, May 9 2017.\n\n\nWith KSR, his entourage, and Mikl, we talked extensively about the role of the world-building one has to do for speculative fiction in helping us think about adaptation, sustainability, and human-environment interactions more generally. Mikl, who was a massive science-fiction nerd, turned to me at one point and said, “you should give a talk on CliFi at the Interval!” I demurred. While it is true that I have read a lot of science fiction and thought a bit about its utility in stimulating imagination, I know nothing about literature or how one even goes about teaching a class rooted in the humanities.\nBut the seed was definitely planted.\nWhen my wife was a fellow at the Center for Advanced Study in the Behavioral Sciences in 2017-2018, I spent a lot of time loitering up on the hill and talking with then-director Margaret Levi and various other smarties like Shaz Attari and Judy Wajcman about CliFi. On a Stanford Alumni Association trip in the summer of 2018, I was inspired by the spectacular locale of the Mashpi Lodge in Ecuador to roll out a first draft of a talk on CliFi. Eventually, I did give a version of the talk at the Interval. I focused on how long-form narrative might fit into the science of behavior change. This led to a nice write-up by the Stanford News Service, where I got to chat about the utility of literature with Pulitzer-Prize-winning author Adam Johnson. That was cool.\nShortly before the COVID-19 pandemic, Margaret Levi and I received a grant from The Changing Human Experience Initiative at Stanford for a project focused on the social imagination in speculative fiction, especially CliFi. There is lots of humanistic scholarship on speculative fiction and there are plenty of physical scientists who weigh in on the topic (and are frequently authors!). But, as noted by Robert Heinlein in his famous 1947 essay, speculative fiction is not fiction about the science and technology, per se, but rather human reactions to new situations caused by science and technology. It seemed to us like there was a real deficit on the social-science scholarship related to world-building and speculative fiction.\nWe had grand plans. Alas, the pandemic really messed them up. It’s a long and not very interesting story—as with so many pandemic-disruption stories—but we decided that the best way to fulfill the spirit of the project was to teach a class. We recruited Paula, who has a long-standing interest in speculative fiction and actually knows about literature!\nSo, here we are. This is the second time we’re teaching the class and it might, alas, be the last. Margaret is retired and winter quarter is her last teaching quarter at Stanford. It should be fun. I’ve learned so much from Margaret and Paula, not to mention our students and TAs. This year, we will read three novels\n\nParable of the Sower by Octavia Butler\nNew York 2140 by Kim Stanley Robinson\nThe Water Knife by Paolo Bacigalupi\n\nIn addition, we will read a number of shorter works, including selections from KSR’s Ministry of the Future, N.K. Jemisin’s novelette, Emergency Skin, and short stories by Malka Older (“Narrative Disorder”) and Charlie Jane Anders (“Because Change was the Ocean and We Lived by her Mercy”). We might even have some visitors, but that’s a secret (for now).\nWe try to triple-team every lecture. I generally talk about the climate science and human ecology; Margaret talks about the governance, history, and social elements of the works; Paula talks about the novels as works of literature, analyzing the plots and characters and generally improving everyone’s analytical game.\nWe start in a week. Here’s hoping my recently-operated-upon ankle has healed enough by then that I can actually walk to class!"

    "title": "Novels (Mostly CliFi) from 2023, Cozy and Otherwise",
    "section": "",
    "text": "I managed to read 28 novels in 2023. Most of these were climate fiction since that remains a teaching (and possibly research) interest.\nIn no particular order, my favorite novels from this past year include:\n\nLauren Wilkinson, American Spy\nThomas D. Lee, Perilous Times\nMalka Older, The Mimicking of Known Successes\nRay Nayler, The Mountain in the Sea\n\nAnother book that I really enjoyed, but wasn’t quite self-contained enough for me to list here is A Psalm for the Wild-Built, Becky Chambers’s first novel in her new cozy CliFi series. I’m anxiously awaiting the next volumes in the series.\nBecky Chambers and Annalee Newitz talk about cozy science fiction more generally in their terrific talk at The Interval, entitled Resisting Dystopia. The idea of resisting dystopia is, in fact, one of the guiding principles of the class I am teaching with Margaret Levi and Paula Moya this quarter. It’s not always easy, I’m afraid.\nMalka Older’s amazing The Mimicking of Known Successes is, apparently, also considered to be of the cozy genre, though I found the setting for it pretty terrifying. A devastated Earth and a scholarly outpost on a gas giant inhospitable to life doesn’t strike me as canonically “cozy,” but I guess there is lots of tea-drinking in academic chambers.\nOne of these things is perhaps not like the others, so merits a moment’s reflection. Wilkinson’s American Spy is a masterful modern take on the spy novel. I think that there are three necessary elements to a successful spy novel. First, and most importantly, there must be moral ambiguity. If it’s not morally ambiguous, are you even spying, bro? Second, there needs to be geographic specificity. The reader needs enough detail to be transported to where the action is, whether it is in some exotic locale, the streets of New York City or London, or the back roads of northern Virginia. Finally, what would a spy novel be without tradecraft? And I don’t mean the Q-esque gadgets here. Neither George Smilely nor Marie Mitchell have—nor need—flame-throwing watches or tricked-out sport cars. Wilkinson delivers spectacularly on all fronts. It is right up there with my all-time favorite spy novels—and I’m an often-disappointed sucker for the genre. A fictionalized account of the assassination of the charismatic leftist president of Burkina Faso, Thomas Sankara, American Spy—as with all the best geopolitical fiction— may force you to learn something if you’re not careful (I did)."
