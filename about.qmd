## About This Blog

I am a professor of Environmental Social Sciences in the [Stanford Doerr School of Sustainability](https://sustainability.stanford.edu/). My research focuses on human ecology and adaptability, demography and life history theory, and infectious-disease ecology. You can find more information on my [lab page](https://heeh.stanford.edu).
